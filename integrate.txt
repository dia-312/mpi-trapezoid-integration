Assignment: MPI Trapezoid Integration (with timing)

Files included:
1) integrate.cpp        - serial version (prints Init, Compute, Comm, Total)
2) func.cpp             - f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 10
3) mpi_integrate_v1.cpp - MPI point-to-point, master receives in order (1..p-1)
4) mpi_integrate_v2.cpp - MPI point-to-point, master receives from MPI_ANY_SOURCE
5) mpi_integrate_v3.cpp - MPI collective (MPI_Reduce)
6) integrate.txt        - this file (description + pseudocode + brief discussion)
7) Makefile             - build & test targets

Pseudocode (common - trapezoid rule):
------------------------------------
read a, b, n
h = (b - a) / n
partition n into local_n for each process (handle remainder)
local_a = a + start_index * h
local_b = local_a + local_n * h

local_sum = (f(local_a) + f(local_b)) / 2
for i = 1 to local_n-1:
    local_sum += f(local_a + i*h)
local_integral = h * local_sum

// communication
v1: send local_integral from ranks 1..p-1 to rank 0; rank 0 receives in order
v2: same but rank 0 receives with MPI_ANY_SOURCE
v3: use MPI_Reduce to sum local_integral to rank 0

Timing:
For serial: use clock() to measure init, compute, comm (0), total
For MPI: use MPI_Wtime() to measure init, compute, comm, total
Print per-process timing: Init, Compute, Comm, Total
Rank 0 prints final result.

Discussion (how to test and what to expect):
-------------------------------------------
- Build: run `make`
- Tests:
    make test1    # ./integrate 1 4 100
    make test2    # mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_integrate_v1 1 4 100
    make test3    # mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_integrate_v2 1 4 100
    make test4    # mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_integrate_v3 1 4 100

- Run experiments with np = 1..6 and n large (e.g., 10000000) to see speedup.
- Expectation:
    * Init time small.
    * Compute time reduces roughly by factor ~p if n >> p and balanced.
    * Comm time increases with p (more messages) for v1/v2; v3 usually cheaper.
    * Total time = init + compute + comm; optimal p depends on workload vs comm cost.

Note:
- Filenames and interface match assignment instructions exactly.
